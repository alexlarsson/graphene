/* graphene_simd4x4f_t uses four graphene_simd4f_t vectors.
 *
 * the matrix is treated as row-major, i.e. the x, y, z, and w vectors
 * are rows, and elements of each vector are a column:
 *
 *   graphene_simd4x4f_t = {
 *     x.x, x.y, x.z, x.w,
 *     y.x, y.y, y.z, y.w,
 *     z.x, z.y, z.z, z.w,
 *     w.x, w.y, w.z, w.w
 *   }
 *
 * the memory layout of a graphene_simd4x4f_t matrix in memory will be
 * identical to GL and Direc3D matrices.
